    <h2>OUR COMMITMENT TO YOU</h2>
    <p>At CleanNexus, your privacy is a top priority. We appreciate that you put your trust in us when you provide us with your information, and we do not take this lightly.</p>
    <p>We do not compromise with your privacy. We design all of our products and services with your privacy in mind. We involve experts from various fields, including legal, security, and others to make sure that no decision is taken without respect for your privacy.</p>
    <p>We strive to be transparent in the way we process your data. Because we use many of the same online services you do, we know that insufficient information and overly complicated language are common issues in privacy policies. We take the exact opposite approach: we have written our Privacy Policy and related documents in plain language. We actually want you to read our policies and understand our privacy practices!</p>
    <p>We work hard to keep your information secure. We have teams dedicated to keeping your data safe and secure. We constantly update our security practices and invest in our security efforts to enhance the safety of your information.</p>

    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>Welcome to CleanNexus’s Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>We appreciate that you trust us with your information, and we intend to always keep that trust. This starts with making sure you understand the information we collect, why we collect it, how it is used, and your choices regarding your information. This Policy describes our privacy practices in plain language, keeping legal and technical jargon to a minimum.</p>

    <h2>WHERE THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to websites, apps, and other services operated by CleanNexus. For simplicity, we refer to all of these as our “services” or “apps” in this Privacy Policy. To make it extra clear, we’ve added links to this Privacy Policy on all applicable services.</p>

    <h2>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
    <h3>Information you give us</h3>
    <p>You choose to give us certain information when using our services. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li style="color:red;">We don't store any type of data on our server. like photos, videos, and contacts, etc. we provide a contact backup service with the user's own iCloud account. users can upload, restore and download backups of contacts with their own iCloud account.</li>
        <li>To use certain features in our services, you may allow us to access your camera or the microphone. Depending on your device, Apple and Android systems will ask for your permission before allowing us to access these features.</li>
        <li>Features that allow you to share content about your use of our services with your connections or through your social network.</li>
        <li>If you contact our support team, we collect the information you give us when you report a problem, contact, or communicate with us.</li>
    </ul>

     <h2>Device information</h2>
    <p>We might collect information from and about the device(s) you use to access our services, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Geolocation data (in some of our apps), which is any information that indicates the geographical position of your device and which may include the time the location was recorded and may include precise (e.g., GPS-level) location data. Some apps may collect this data when the app is not open or actively in use. This may help us or third parties to customize information, content, or offers to you, for instance.</li>
        <li>Information on your wireless and mobile network connection, like your service provider and signal strength.</li>
        <li>Hardware and software information such as IP address, device type, app crashes, app version, advertising IDs (such as Google’s AdvertisingID and Apple’s IDFA, both of which are randomly generated numbers that you can reset by going into your device’s settings), browser type, version and language, operating system, time zones, identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser (e.g., IMEI/UDID and MAC address).</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>COOKIES AND OTHER SIMILAR DATA COLLECTION TECHNOLOGIES</h2>
    <p>As described in Sections 3 and 5 of this Privacy Policy, we sometimes work with third parties to deliver ads or offers. Sometimes we or these third parties do so through a mobile “SDK.” The SDK is a bit of computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable data to be collected and ads to be shown. We may use this and similar technology to deliver certain advertising through mobile applications and browsers based on data associated with your mobile device, and we may work with third parties who likewise embed their SDKs into our services, for third-party advertising. If you’d like to opt-out from having ads tailored to you in this way on your mobile device, please follow the instructions below or in the app (as applicable).</p>

    <p>If you wish to opt out of interest-based tracking through your mobile device, you can do so through your device “settings”, as follows (but please note that the below is for informational purposes only and Apple, Google, or other device platforms may change the manner in which their “opt-out” settings work at any time): Please note that if you opt out through these settings, you will continue to receive advertising after you opt-out, but it may not be tailored to your interests. For instance, web browser ads may not be tailored to your interests, but may still be selected based on certain factors such as your general location (derived from your IP address), the content of the web page being viewed, and the search term you entered (if any).</p>

    <h3>Google Android</h3>
    <p>Android offers a “Limit Ad Tracking” setting. To opt-out of interest-based ads on Android, follow these instructions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open your Google settings on your Android device</li>
        <li>Select “Ads”</li>
        <li>You may then see an option for “Opt out of interest-based ads” or “Opt out of Ads Personalization”</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Apple iOS</h3>
    <p>Apple iOS devices offer a “Limit Ad Tracking” setting. To opt-out of interest-based ads on your iOS device, follow these instructions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open “Settings” on your Apple device</li>
        <li>Select “Privacy”</li>
        <li>Select “Advertising”</li>
        <li>You may then see an option for “Limit Ad Tracking”</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Please note that these are device settings and do not affect interest-based advertising from other companies. You must opt out of interest-based advertising from each company through the methods described in Section 6 above.</p>
